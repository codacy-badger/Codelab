                The Safety Performance Function (SPF) Tool was built with the user in mind. The SPF Tool possesses an aesthetic and minimalist design to accommodate every user. The built-in data visualization tool allows the presentation of advanced analysis results in an easy and understandable way. SPF provides an intuitive step-by-step analysis wizard to allow for comfortable and user-friendly analysis. By having all the information at your fingertips, you can perform transportation management tasks quickly and more efficiently. The SPF Tool was designed to incorporate the most advanced state-of-the-art statistical techniques to allow for efficient transportation safety analyses. The SPF Tool is a cloud-based application and does not have the typical limitations of desktop software packages (e.g., typical software packages are closed systems with slow computing power and require a per-computer installation). The SPF Tool allows for inherent cross-platform support of devices such as laptops, PCs, tablets, and smartphones.
