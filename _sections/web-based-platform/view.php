                    Flexible access management is an integrated part of the SPF Tool. An integrated incorporated access wizard allows the master user to assign other users (e.g., consultant, sub consultant) to selected projects. You only need to share data necessary to accomplish specific tasks/projects. The SPF Tool protects your data from unauthorized people, destructive forces, infection, or corruption of information. Our data are encrypted and protected from the unwanted actions of unauthorized users
